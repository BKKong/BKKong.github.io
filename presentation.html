        <div class="page-contents">
          According a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research,
          the gender pay gap widens significantly between ages 25–44, when
          many women have children. Unmarried women without children
          continue to earn closer than what men do.

          <p>This visualization uses a slideshow with templates for visual consistency. The slideshow starts with a general overview of the gender pay gap in the U.S., then the following slides discuss different aspects of the gender pay gap by year, by age group and by geographic locations.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Does the narrative visualization correctly follow the hybrid structure?<br>
              Yes. The narrative visualization uses the interactive slideshow structure and users can manipulate the visualization in various pages. Readers can scroll to the page they want to see and they can use mouse tip to investigate a certain data point in the slideshow.</li>
            <li>Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize scenes?<br>
              Yes. Two scenes are used consistently to guide the readers. The first scene is a display of key ideas with a picture in the background, and this template is used for pages 2, 4 and 6. The other scene is a display of visualization charts with white background.  This template is used for pages 3, 5, and 7.</li>
            <li>Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize annotations?<br>
              Yes. On page 3, annotations are used to highlight the year and the women’s pay as a percentage of the men’s, so that readers can read the exact number of the line chart. Annotations are also used on page 5 to indicate women’s and men’s median weekly earnings and percentages. Annotations on the same page follow the same template to maintain a neat and organized scene. Annotations are cleared between scenes because different pages present different information, and old annotations may become irrelevant.</li>
            <li>Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize parameters?<br>
              Yes. On page 3, years (x-axis) are the parameters. The D3 codes are written in such a way that the position of the mouse on the x-axis controls the annotations displayed. Therefore, when the mouse moves, the state of the visualization changes.</li>
            <li>Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize triggers?<br>
              Yes. On both pages 3 and 5, there are sentences “Hover to explore” on the upper portion of the page to inform readers that they can move the mouse to explore the visualization. When the readers do so, the horizontal position of the mouse will trigger the parameter change (year change).</li>
